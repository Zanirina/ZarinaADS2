This Java project provides implementations of various data structures, including MyArrayList, MyLinkedList, Queue, Stack, and Heap. These classes are designed to demonstrate the underlying mechanics and principles of these data structures.

Data Structures Implemented
1. MyArrayList
MyArrayList is an implementation of a dynamic array, similar to Java's built-in ArrayList. It provides methods to add, remove, and access elements in the array.
Features:
Adding and removing elements
Setting and retrieving elements
Sorting list

2. MyLinkedList
MyLinkedList is a doubly-linked list implementation. It provides methods to add, remove, and traverse the list.
Features:
Doubly-linked nodes
Adding and removing elements
Setting and retrieving elements
Traversal operations
Sorting list

3. Queue
Queue is a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structure. The provided implementation supports enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations.
Features:
Enqueue (add)
Dequeue (remove)
Peek (retrieve without removal)

4. Stack
Stack is a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data structure. The provided implementation supports push, pop, and peek operations.
Features:
Push (add)
Pop (remove)
Peek (retrieve without removal)

5. Heap
Heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. The provided implementation supports insert, delete, and peek operations.

Features:
Min heap
Insertion
Deletion
Retrieving
Peek (retrieve the root element)
Heapify
